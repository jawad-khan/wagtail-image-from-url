Deprecated `setup.py` stub.

Project metadata and build configuration have been migrated to `pyproject.toml`.

Please use modern tooling instead of running this file directly. Examples:

  # install editable with test extras
  python -m pip install -e '.[test]'

  # build distributions
  python -m pip install --upgrade build
  python -m build

This file is intentionally minimal and contains no install-time logic.

# Intentionally left minimal. See pyproject.toml for canonical package metadata.
